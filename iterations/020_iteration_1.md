## Iteration 1

Let's explore some basic concepts of Docker.

### Docker Images

Docker Images are the key element of Docker and the base for every container you'll run. There is a public registry hosted by Docker called ```index```. You can find it over [here](https://index.docker.io). You'll find a bunch of publicly available images for pretty much everything you want (plain Ubuntu, Ruby, Python, PHP, etc). These are a good starting point to build your own container.

#### Layers

http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/use/workingwithrepository/
- comparable to git repositories
- layered
- tags

### The Registry (Index)

- docker index
- storage backend for images
- picture it as Github for your container
- as for git, you can host it yourself

### Pull

- busybox
- simple echo command

### PS

### Inspect

### Run a Redis Server

### Diff

### Expose a Port
